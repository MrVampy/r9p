# r9p

`r9p` is the reusable Rust 9P library for substrate-shaped systems. It owns
9P2000 wire types, encoding/decoding, fid/tag/session mechanics, and generic
client/server protocol state. It does not own any particular filesystem,
editor, Vault, FUSE, socket, async runtime, or transport policy.

Current surfaces and consumers:

- `r9p`, a plan9port `9p`-shaped client CLI for one-shot reads, writes,
  stats, listings, creates, removes, and console-style interaction.
- Racme serves an Acme-compatible 9P namespace through `r9p`.
- `r9pfuse` uses `r9p` to mount 9P namespaces through Linux FUSE.

The architectural boundary is deliberately small:

- `r9p` speaks 9P.
- Backends decide what paths mean.
- Clients decide what they consume.
- Runtime adapters own sockets, threads, async tasks, BEAM ports, TLS, and
  FUSE.

## Scope

`r9p` incorporates both sides of the protocol:

- The server core owns session state, fid binding, request admission, and a
  backend-neutral `FileTree` trait.
- The client core owns operation construction, tag/fid allocation, and response
  admission.

The crate keeps full transport loops and operator tools layered over the
reusable client/server core.

## CLI

The operator-facing client tracks the shape of plan9port's `9p` command:

```bash
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] version [service]
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] attach [service]
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] read path
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] readfd path
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] write [-l] path
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] write-at path offset
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] writefd path
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] stat path
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] rdwr path
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] ls [-ldnt] path...
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] rm path...
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] create path...
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] mkdir path...
r9p [-n] [-a address] [-A aname] [-u uname] [-m msize] con [-r] path
```

`-a` accepts `host:port`, `tcp!host!port`, bare hosts defaulting to port 564,
and `unix!/path/to/socket`. Without `-a`, paths use the plan9port namespace
shape: `service/subpath` connects to `$NAMESPACE/service` and walks `subpath`.
`-n` and `-D` are accepted for plan9port command-line compatibility; `r9p`
always uses the noauth attach path today.

The CLI is a blocking client facade over the reusable library. It is not the
boundary of the library itself.

## Development

```bash
cargo run --bin r9p -- -a 127.0.0.1:9564 ls /
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
nix flake check
```
